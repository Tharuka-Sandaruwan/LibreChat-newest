Forked from : https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat

contains my modified version

please replace the api keys in env and librechat.yaml with your own

can do find and replace to search and replace "addyourownkey" with your own api key

uses azure openai endpoints to gpt4 latest models with dalle 3 integration

RAG to scaan and answer questions from documents not employed as it costs more credits in azure
can implement that locally as well - TODO
